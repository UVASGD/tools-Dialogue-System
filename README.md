# Dope Dialogue
Dope Dialogue is a **unique** inventory and dialogue system for Unity designed to speed up the process of creating dialogue heavy projects with a visual scripting tool. It was also meant to be **ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!** (unlike some systems currently available in the Asset Store). Unfortunately, the project is currently under heavy development, so you can't use it in all its *glory* just yet. :\

## Planned Features
In the future, here's what I'd like to allow you to be able to do:

- **Script Editor** - edit scripting events in a visual node editor modelled after Unreal Engine's Blueprints
- **include a database of scripts, dialogue, and inventory**
- **use variables with scope**, either local to a single script or global between all scripts
- **quick integration to custom UI elements** - this means you can have the system display dialogue, inventory, quests, and whatnot to a canvas
- **Saving** - any in-game changes to data can be stored in a save file 
- **Unity Packages** - import the system at any time to your project using a Unity package file
 
## Script Editor
Just look up Unreal's blueprints. The script editor is designed to be a simpler version of it, so most behaviour will be ~~stolen~~ from there.
